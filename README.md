# Stazi Technologies Assignment

This Real Estate Listing website is a simple application built using React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and uses icons from FontAwesome. It allows users to view and explore properties listed in different cities.

## Features

- Users can view properties in different cities, including New York, Mumbai, Paris, and London.
- Each city has a set of featured property listings with details such as location, number of rooms, number of beds, number of baths, and area size.
- Users can click on property cards to view more details about a specific property.
- The website provides a "Show More" button to load additional property listings dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- React: The application is built using the React library, which provides a component-based architecture for building user interfaces.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface. It offers a utility-first approach to styling, making it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs.

- FontAwesome: FontAwesome icons are used to enhance the visual appeal of the website by adding icons for various elements, such as arrows, hearts, and hourglasses.
